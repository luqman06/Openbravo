This file contains a description of the usage of Compiere Inc. assets within
Openbravo ERP and the changes that Openbravo implemented on those assets.

Java and XSQL Code
------------------
Some Java and XSQL files are inspired by Compiere ERP & CRM v.2.5.0c. In 
particular, some of Openbravo Java classes use some Compiere files as model
and replicate their business logic in a different implementation.
The following list contains the name of the Openbravo files that have been
developed in this manner and maps them to the Compiere files that have been
used as model:

PL/SQL Code
-----------
The following PL/SQL functions, procedures and triggers were originally
developed by Compiere Inc. and distributed in Compiere ERP & CRM v.2.5.0c. 
Openbravo has modified them in order to satisfy its own functional and
technical requirements. Whenever the name was change, the PL/SQL object is 
listed with its new name and the original Compiere name is reported in brackets.
This PL/SQL code is currently distributed by Openbravo using XML files stored
in the /src-db/database folder and named after the database objects
themselves. Each file properly identifies Compiere Inc. as the original 
developer using comments.

Database Tables
---------------
The following database tables and views were originally designed by Compiere
Inc. and distributed in Compiere ERP & CRM v.2.5.0c.
Openbravo modified them in order to satisfy its own functional and technical
requirements. Whenever the name was change, the table is listed with its new
name and the original Compiere name is reported in brackets:

  AD_IMPFORMAT
  AD_IMPFORMAT_ROW
  I_BANKSTATEMENT
  I_BPARTNER
  I_ELEMENTVALUE
  I_GLJOURNAL
  I_INVENTORY
  I_INVOICE
  I_ORDER
  I_PRODUCT

These tables and views are currently distributed by Openbravo using XML files
stored in the /src-db/database folder and named after the tables themselves.

Database Records
----------------
The following database tables contain records that have been originally 
defined by Compiere Inc. and distributed in Compiere ERP & CRM v.2.5.0c.
Openbravo modified them in order to satisfy its own functional and
technical requirements:

  AD_COLUMN
  AD_ELEMENT
  AD_FIELD
  AD_FORM
  AD_IMPFORMAT
  AD_IMPFORMAT_ROW
  AD_MENU
  AD_PREFERENCE
  AD_PROCESS
  AD_PROCESS_PARA
  AD_REFERENCE
  AD_REF_LIST
  AD_REF_TABLE
  AD_TAB
  AD_TABLE
  AD_TREENODE
  AD_VAL_RULE
  AD_WINDOW

These tables also contain additional records that have been autonomously 
defined by Openbravo. The  records derived by Compiere can be identified by
their ID range:
        - Records identified by an ID lower than 100000 are based upon
          Compiere
        - Records identified by an ID higher or equal to 100000 have been 
          added by Openbravo
The content of these tables is currently distributed by Openbravo using XML
files stored in the /src-db/database folder and named after the tables
themselves.
